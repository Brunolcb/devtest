# Dev Test 2022

Here's a blank project. You're goal is to
- connect to a database
- crud some data
- serve it somehow
- add some flair with a business rule or two
- state the goals of the system

You will be marked on how well your tests cover the code and how useful they would be in a prod system.

You will need to provide a database of some sort. This could be as simple as a sqlite or as complicated as a docker container with a migrations file

Don't spend more than 8 hours on this. Projects that pass PR are paid at the standard hourly rate.

Submit a link to your github PR(s) into a main branch. I will review it, offer any feedback and if it passes PR you will proceed onto the next step.
